Looping: which are used to repeat statements. Loops are always finite

Types of loops:->
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while loop

    1. for loop:->This loops is used when number of times body of loop is to be executed in pre-defined
             Syntax:
                     for
                     {
                     //body of for loop
                     }
    2. while loop:->while loop is used when number of times body of loop is to be executed is not known
               Syntax:
                       while(condition)
                       {
                       //body of loop
                       }
                   
    3. do while loop:-> In do while loop condition is evaluated at end. Therefore ,body of loop is executed at least once.
                Syntax:
                         do
                         {
                         //body of loop
                         }
                         while(condition);
                         
                         
                                    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHILE AND DO WHILE
         
                 while                                                                   do while
    a. Condition is checked first                                                Condition is checked later on.
    b. Control goes in loop when the condition is true.                          Control goes once in loop at first and comes out of loop if it gets false                      
    c. Entry controlled loop                                                     Exit controlled loop
